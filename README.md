This code was created as part of an individual project for a master's degree in Human and Social Data Science at the University of Sussex. The goal of publishing this code is to give a reproducible code that may be used by others on the same issue with the same data or new sets of data if feasible.

Abstract of this study is as follows:

The pursuit of accurate financial prediction tools has long been at the forefront of study and strategy development in the complex world of financial markets. However, machine learning (ML) models have made it possible to analyses and forecast future values of high-frequency data owing to their capacity to study and deal with massive amounts of data. Therefore, this study focuses on investigating the intersection of high-frequency financial predictions by forecasting trading signals with the application of machine learning models. The study not only tackles the inherent obstacles of analyzing such data, but it also emphasizes machine learning models' revolutionary potential within the financial markets. It has been found that machine learning models, particularly random forest classifiers, have succeeded in predicting buy and sell current trading signs on a sample of one liquid and one illiquid regular stock listed in the stock exchange market of Hong Kong (HKEX) with a testing accuracy of 90.14% and 89.62%, respectively, leading to promising predictions with a high possibility of further financial forecasting on frequent financial data through the robust application of different ML models.

Research main question is as follow:

In the presence of high-frequency data, can machine learning models forecast forthcoming buy and sell trade signals?


Sub- Questions:
What machine learning models should be used to fit the model?
What predictors and attributes should be included in the model while training?
What method might be used to generate a trading sign?

In this code, we present the Python codes used for the analysis and modelling of both illiquid and liquid stocks, namely China Tianrui Group Cement Co. Ltd. and Alibaba Health Information Technology. Although the codes are largely similar, they were studied separately for each stock to account for their unique characteristics.
